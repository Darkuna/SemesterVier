Benchmark -> Solutions on Google Drive File

Improvements:
 - use o2 for performance boost
 - use more flags for performance boost
 - use a thread per section (picture height/nr of threads)
 - check cache misses behaved by for loop (maybe change loop variables)

parallelize:
 - split picture into sub pictures and do the calculation for each sub picture with a seperate thread
